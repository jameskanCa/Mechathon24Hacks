RHEMAP is developed to help tackle waitlines for rehabilitation centers in Vancouver and better direct patients to the most suitable rehabilitation center. 

Core features: 
1. Profile development (Dynamic survey based) 
2. Rehabilitation center suggestions based on profile.
3. Real time update for bed space at various centers. 

With profile developed, we can further to engage in preventitive care by using the data in machine learning to predict potential scenarios that could lead to drug dependencies. 

The concept of RHEMAP was developed at Mechathon 2018, at SFU Surrey. The event was a 24 hour hackathon and this concept not only won first in our topic area (Community Impact Award) and top overall in the event.
